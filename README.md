# Summary

The Public Administration curriculum is a **complete education in Public Administration** using online materials.
It emphasizes a logical progression from foundational concepts to advanced applications, balancing theoretical understanding, practical skills, and synthesis.

## Organization

This repository is organized into three main components:

- **Core Curriculum** (this page): the foundational knowledge of the field;
- **[Advanced Topics](advanced_topics.md)**: focused study in specific areas;

**Process:** Learners may work through the curriculum independently or collaboratively, and either sequentially or selectively.

- For simplicity, courses in the Core Curriculum are ordered according to their prerequisites.
- The Core Curriculum provides a shared foundation and is intended to be completed in full.
- Advanced Topics are optional; learners are encouraged to select one area of focus and complete all courses within that topic.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md).

## How to use this curriculum

### Core Sections

These four sections form the essential backbone of the discipline. Study them in this exact order:

1. **Foundations of Public Administration**  
   Start here. This section gives you the basic concepts, history, and context you need before anything else makes sense.

2. **Public Organizations and Management**  
   Next, learn how public organizations actually work and how they are led and managed in practice.

3. **Law, Ethics, and Accountability**  
   Then move to the legal rules, ethical standards, and oversight mechanisms that shape and constrain all public administrative action.

4. **Policy Process and Implementation**  
   Finally, understand how public policies are created, decided upon, and carried out in the real world.
