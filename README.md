## How to use this curriculum

### Core Sections

These four sections form the essential backbone of the discipline. Study them in this exact order:

1. **I. Foundations of Public Administration**  
   Start here. This section gives you the basic concepts, history, and context you need before anything else makes sense.

2. **II. Public Organizations and Management**  
   Next, learn how public organizations actually work and how they are led and managed in practice.

3. **III. Law, Ethics, and Accountability**  
   Then move to the legal rules, ethical standards, and oversight mechanisms that shape and constrain all public administrative action.

4. **IV. Policy Process and Implementation**  
   Finally, understand how public policies are created, decided upon, and carried out in the real world.

### Specialization Tracks

The remaining four sections are optional tracks that build on the core. You can choose one, two, or more depending on your interests and goals. They are:

- **V. Methods, Evidence, and Analysis**  
  (data, research, and analytical skills for evidence-based public work)

- **VI. Public Finance and Budgeting**  
  (money, taxation, budgets, and fiscal decision-making in government)

- **VII. Applied Policy Domains**  
  (specific policy areas such as environment, health, and digital government)

- **VIII. Comparative, International, and Nonprofit Administration**  
  (how public administration works in other countries, in international development, and in nonprofit/third-sector organizations)
