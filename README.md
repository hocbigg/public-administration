# Summary

The Public Administration curriculum is a **complete education in Public Administration** using online materials.
It emphasizes a logical progression from foundational concepts to advanced applications, balancing theoretical understanding, practical skills, and synthesis.

## Organization

- **Intro Public Administration**: Orientation to fundamentals of government, politics, and economic principles in public contexts.
- **Core: Public Administration**
    - Phase I: Core Foundations: Essential subjects building core knowledge in policy, organization, and finance.
    - Phase II: Advanced Core: Deeper tools for analysis, ethics, and management.
- **Advanced Public Administration**: Elective tracks for focus, culminating in applied synthesis.
    - **Public Policy and Analysis**: Focus on evaluating and designing policies in specific domains.
    - **Nonprofit Management**: Emphasis on community and voluntary sector leadership.
    - **International and Comparative Administration**: Exploration of global systems and development.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

**Process**. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order.

- We recommend doing all courses in **Core**, only skipping a course when you are certain that you've already learned the material previously.
- For simplicity, we recommend working through courses (especially Core) in order from top to bottom. Some students choose to study multiple courses at a time in order to vary the material they are working on in a day/week.
- The courses in the Advanced section are electives. Choose one track to specialize in and complete all the courses listed under it.
